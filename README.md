I'm a PhD student at the University of Queensland, in the School of Mathematics and Physics. I study numerical methods for gravitational N-body simulations and the evolution of star clusters using high performance computing.

Also, I'm a software engineer in the aerospace industry. I specialise in the modeling and simulation of physical phenomena. I like to learn how stuff works and figure out how to represent it in code.

Join me for a beer.
